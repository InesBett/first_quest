## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide an interactive gaming experience where players navigate through the game with challenges.

## Methodology

The game is developed entirely in Python, utilizing fundamental concepts. Players make choices and navigate through the game by responding to prompts and challenges presented in the console.

## Project Structure

This project consists of a single Python script that serves as the main game engine. The script contains all the necessary code to run the game and guide players through their adventures in the world of GAME NAME.

## Project Development Time

The development time of this project spanned over a period of 2 weeks, during which the team dedicated their efforts and acquired knowledge to implement the game mechanics, create the storytelling, and optimize the user experience.

## Conclusion

This is our first project on GitHub, and we are very excited to share it with you! With this game, we aimed to showcase the knowledge we acquired over the past weeks during the Bootcamp, translating our ideas into code using Python.

On behalf of the team, we hope you enjoy GAME NAME as much as we enjoyed the process of creating it.

Thank you all üòä
